import Foundation

/// Applies the non-colour half of an appearance theme, keeps it up to date while
/// that theme is selected, and puts the user's own settings back when they leave it.
///
/// Before this existed, importing an appearance pack scattered its contents across
/// a dozen independent `GlobalSettings` keys, so selecting 默認 again reverted the
/// five theme colours and nothing else: the pack's tab icons, font, covers, glass
/// and bookshelf layout stayed put with no way to undo them.
///
/// Two mechanisms, both funnelled through `AppearanceThemeExtras`:
///
/// 1. **A baseline, not a per-setting override**, so no read site has to learn about
///    themes: the first time a custom theme is selected the user's own values are
///    captured, and selecting a theme that speaks for nothing writes that capture
///    back. Switching straight from one theme to another keeps the original
///    baseline, so the way out is always the way in.
/// 2. **Write-back while a theme is selected.** Editing a covered setting records it
///    on the selected theme (`updateActiveThemeExtras`), which is what makes each
///    theme keep its own covers, font and icons instead of leaving the change on
///    whichever theme happens to be selected next. The write is per field, so a
///    pack keeps saying nothing about the settings the user never touched.
