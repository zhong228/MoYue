/// Where async code runs synchronous source-script work — a parse, a `loginCheckJs`, a login
/// menu's script.
///
/// Source JS runs on its engine's own queue while the caller waits for the result. A script
/// can stop for the reader — `java.startBrowserAwait`, `java.getVerificationCode` — for as
/// long as the reader takes, and a Swift concurrency thread that waits that long is gone from
/// a pool the size of the CPU: a few sources waiting at once (a search across several
/// Cloudflare-protected sources, 書源驗證) left no thread for any other async work in the
/// app. The threads here are GCD's, which adds threads when its own are blocked — what
/// Legado's IO dispatcher gives its source scripts.
///
/// Every synchronous call into source JS from async code goes through `run` — rules, the
/// fetch-time URL and response scripts, `loginCheckJs`, login menus, 段評 actions, image
/// decoding, RSS rules and TTS scripts. The one exception is a `@js:` header rule, which
/// `BookSource.parsedHeaders` evaluates synchronously once per source revision and caches:
/// none of the 115 such rules in 4,765 real sources reaches a user wait.
