/// Framesetters owned by exactly one executor.
///
/// A chapter's chunks share one CTFramesetter, and once slicing hands the chunks
/// over, the main thread owns it: materialization, hit testing and selection all
/// lay out with it. Core Text layout objects (CTFramesetter, CTTypesetter, CTFrame,
/// CTLine, CTRun) are used by one operation, queue or thread at a time, so an
/// executor that builds chunk frames off the main thread keeps its own instance of
/// this cache and never touches `CoreTextChunk.framesetter`.
///
/// Framesetters come from the slicer's factory (same typesetter options), and
/// frames from `CoreTextChunk.makeFrame(using:)`, so lines break identically.
/// Measured 2026-09-21 (simulator, ABBA): creating one costs 1.2 ms for a
/// 3.4k-character TXT chapter and 3.6 ms for a styled one, once per chapter; the
/// frames it builds cost the same as the shared framesetter's. Serializing the
/// shared framesetter instead would make the main thread wait up to one frame
/// build (1.7 ms median there, far more on an efficiency core).
///
/// Not thread-safe by design: confine an instance to its executor.
