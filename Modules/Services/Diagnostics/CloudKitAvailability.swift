/// kills the app on the spot — that is the startup crash LiveContainer users hit
/// from the first build. LiveContainer runs the app as a *copy* under its own
/// host process (`LiveProcess.appex`): the host is signed and may itself be
/// entitled for iCloud, so a signed-in iPhone yields a non-`nil`
/// `ubiquityIdentityToken` in that process too — but the host's entitlement
/// list never contains this app's container (`iCloud.com.zhangruilin.yuedureader`),
/// so constructing the container there still `os_crash`es.
///
/// Every CloudKit entry point (`ICloudSyncManager`, `SubscriptionICloudMirror`)
/// must check `isAvailable` first and degrade (iCloud sync off, mirror read
/// returns nil) instead of constructing a container. Signed builds installed via
/// Xcode / TestFlight / App Store keep the real entitlement and CloudKit works
/// unchanged.
