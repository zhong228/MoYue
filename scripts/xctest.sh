# Run xcodebuild tests and stop the moment the verdict lands.
#
# xcodebuild regularly finishes every test, prints the verdict, and then sits at 0% CPU for
# five to fifteen minutes without exiting or writing another line. Measured 2026-09-13:
# tests done at 02:44:31, log's last write 02:45:11, process still alive and idle at 02:53.
# `-parallel-testing-enabled NO` does not prevent this — it prevents the simulator *clones*
# (verified: zero clones left behind), which is a different problem.
#
# So this does not wait for the process to exit. It watches the log for a verdict and kills
# xcodebuild as soon as one appears. The verdict is the result; the wrap-up is not.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/xctest.sh [-l LOG] [-- <extra xcodebuild args>]
#   scripts/xctest.sh -- -only-testing:'yuedu appTests/TTSRoleVoiceCastTests'

# Drop a stale copy of the app's module before the tests compile against it.
#
# `@testable import yuedu_app` resolves to BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR/yuedu_app.swiftmodule, a copy
# the app target makes of the module it emits under Intermediates. The test target does wait
# for that copy (its begin-compiling gate includes the app's modules-ready, which includes the
# Copy) — but Xcode can judge the Copy up to date while the copy is older than the module.
# Measured 2026-09-28 with Xcode open on this project, sharing this DerivedData: a copy written
# at 12:26 by that other build survived three command-line builds that re-emitted the module
# (13:34, 13:41, 13:44); the tests compiled against the 12:26 app and failed on code written
# after it ("no member 'isBookmarked'"). Had the API not changed, they would have passed while
# testing old code. Once a command-line build had written the copy itself, later edits were
# copied every time.
#
# A copy whose bytes differ from the module the app last emitted is stale by definition, so it
# goes, and Xcode has to copy again. An identical copy is left alone: replacing it would change
# its timestamp and make the whole test target recompile for nothing.
# Delete this block once, with Xcode open on the project and a stale copy put back by hand,
# a run compiles the tests against the fresh module without it.
